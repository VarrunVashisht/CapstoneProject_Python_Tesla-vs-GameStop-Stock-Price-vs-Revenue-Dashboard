## 💹 Tesla vs GameStop — Stock Price vs Revenue Dashboard
🧠 An IBM Data Analyst Capstone project comparing real company performance and market behavior.

## 📘 Overview
This project is part of the IBM Data Analytics Professional Certificate (Coursera) program.
As a data scientist working for an investment firm, your task is to analyze and visualize how company revenue affects stock prices — using Tesla (TSLA) and GameStop (GME) as real-world examples.

Both companies made headlines:
Tesla (TSLA) became profitable, causing a steady, fundamentals-based price increase.

GameStop (GME) soared due to social media hype (Reddit’s WallStreetBets), not business growth.

This project helps demonstrate how real revenue performance compares to market-driven speculation.

🎯 Objectives

By completing this project, you will:
✅ Extract stock price data using the yfinance API
✅ Perform web scraping to collect company revenue data
✅ Clean and prepare both datasets using pandas
✅ Build interactive visual dashboards using Plotly
✅ Compare Tesla and GameStop visually and interpret results
